## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

This was then used to work through the Next.js tutorial, to create a dashboard that pulls data from a database using PostGREs.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
